# Jaguar SDK 25/BPEG Example

This example relies on converting images to a special format called .bpg.

## What is it?
This is done through a DOS command line tool called Dosemu that is provided with the jaguar SDK.

## Troubleshooting

* Dosemu only work with Ubuntu 18.04 or earlier version.
* Even though you can execute the tool on your system, it happens to fail on converting the images used in this example (a.k.a. patrick.tga and fish.tga). A workaround is to take two pictures from the pics folder and rename them.
