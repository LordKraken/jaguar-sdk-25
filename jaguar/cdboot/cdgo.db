# CDGO.DB - script for controlled boot with the Jaguar CD
# or Emulator V2.10 or bigger
# Note: 
# This assumes CDBOOT.ROM was loaded into Alpine Space at 802000
# This is working only with CDBOOT.ROM 95-Aug-8 / CDBIOS 4.05

# These two patches allow boot to run with
# the Emulator 
sw 803038 604e
sl 803964 8000

# this installs the ROM code in Jaguar DRAM 
g802000,80206e

# this executes the bootcode from DRAM, installs the CDBIOS 
# and identifies the boottrack
g,50ff4

# using this instead allows to enter a fake location 
# of the boottrack for debugging purposes
# g,50fdc   
# setting the timecode in d0:
# xd0 00mmssff 
# g,50ff4


# this goes until you bootcode is loaded from the first track in the 
# second session of your CD
g,3aec

# this executes the jump to your bootcode and stops with the 68k PC
# pointing to the first instruction of your bootcode
