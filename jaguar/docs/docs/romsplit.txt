------------
INTRODUCTION
------------

ROMSPLIT.EXE was designed to take a standard .ROM file and split it 
into the pieces necessary for most EPROM burners. Some EPROM burners 
can accept input from a single file. This program handles those that 
cannot.

The three primary configurations of EPROM/ROM destinations are:

1. Four 4 Mbit, 8-bit wide chips (for 2 Mb Test Cartridges)
2. Two 8 Mbit, 16-bit wide chips (for 2 Mb Production Cartridges)
3. Two 16 Mbit, 16-bit wide chips (for 4 Mb Test/Production Cartridges)

When creating files for 8-bit wide chip configuration, ROMSPLIT.EXE 
creates four files with the same root as the source file and the 
following four extensions: U1, U2, U3, and U4. Files with the 
extensions .HI and .LO are created for 16-bit wide chips.

-----------------------
COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS
-----------------------

The command-line format for ROMSPLIT.EXE is as follows:

romsplit sourcefile[.rom] [-bw24pe]

-b: Specify that this file is destined for 8-bit wide chips (default).
-w: Specify that this file is destined for 16-bit wide chips.

-2: Specify that this file is destined for a 2 Mb cartridge (default).
-4: Specify that this file is destined for a 4 Mb cartridge.
	
-p: Pad the first 8192 bytes with $FF.
    You must specify this option if you haven't already padded the .ROM file.

-e: Force the created files to fill cartridge space (pad with $FF).
    Normally the files are extended to the nearest power of 2 in size.

-------------
COMMON USAGES
-------------

If you have a 2 Mb (or less) .ROM file that you could normally read into the 
Jaguar Debugger and execute with the command 'read romfile.rom 802000' you 
should use the following command to make Eprom-ready files:

romsplit romfile.rom -p

If you have a 4 Mb .ROM file readable by the debugger at $802000 then you 
should use the following command:

romsplit romfile.rom -w -4 -p

If your file is pre-padded to start at $800000 then omit the '-p'.

-------
MERGING
-------

ROMSPLIT.EXE may also be used to merge files it has split back together 
again. Simply specify the filename of one of the output files (with any of 
the output extensions) and it will merge the files together into a .ROM. For 
example:

romsplit romfile.u1

REVISION HISTORY
----------------
v1.1 fixes a bug that would cause ROMSPLIT to improperly identify a filetype
when an extension was specified.
