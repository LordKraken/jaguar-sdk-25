We are proud to present a new document that will serve as a tutorial to using
the Jaguar Sound and Music tools.  The document is provided in a variety of
different formats.  Pick one, load the document, and print it.  The available
formats are:

1) Word For Windows 6.0     JAGUAR\DOCS\MIDIDOCS\WINWORD.6\JAGMIDI.DOC
2) Word For Windows 2.0     JAGUAR\DOCS\MIDIDOCS\WINWORD.6\JAGMIDI.DOC
3) Windows Write            JAGUAR\DOCS\MIDIDOCS\JAGMIDI.WRI
4) Rich Text Format         JAGUAR\DOCS\MIDIDOCS\JAGMIDI.RTF

They are listed in the order of preference (ie. if you have Word 6.0, then use
File #1 instead of File #3, or if you have Word 2.0, then use File #2, etc.)

A raw ASCII version is not provided because of the formatting requirements of
the document.  This may change after we have had a chance to adjust the
formatting.
