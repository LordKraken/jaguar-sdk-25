15-jan-1995:
	PC/DOS: Replaced "as.exe" in AGPU and M68K directories with one that
	searches MAC.EXE in the PATH and executes it instead. You must then be
	sure that MAC.EXE in in your path.

20-jan-1995:
	Moved "readme.txt" to "readme.gcc".
	Created "history.gcc".
	AGPU: Fixed typo in umodsi: move->store.
	Reported by Jamie @ Rebellion.

27-jan-1995:
	M68K: Fixed output of switch table.
	AGPU: Fixed recognition of first function. Was broken when first
	function ended with a BARRIER.
	Reported by Dan @ Rebellion.
	AGPU: Check if optimising before scanning insn_addresses.
	Could cause a segmentation fault when no -O was specified.

01-feb-1995:
	ALL: Changed .SKIP to .DCB.B.
	Reported by Dan @ Rebellion.

05-feb-1995:
	AGPU: Fixed output of MOVEQ;NOT.
	Reported by Dan @ Rebellion.

06-feb-1995:
	AGPU: Fixed umodsi3 (negative AGPU modulo pb).
	Reported by Dan @ Rebellion.
	AGPU: Added udivmodsi4, worthful since umodsi3 is now longer.
	AGPU: Fixed a break in loop jump optimisation, seems to a GCC pb (I
	turned around it, but I will post the pb).
	Reported by Dan @ Rebellion.
	AGPU: Fixed a pb in CC generation.
	AGPU: Fixed getting command line stack size.
	AGPU: Changed all default library names to __axxxx because they
	conflict with M68K names.
	Requested by Dan @ Rebellion.

07-feb-1995:
	AGPU: Optimized output of -32..-1 and 32..63 constants even in -O2!
	AGPU: Fixed an oops... multiply was removed on 06-feb-1995!
	Reported by Dan @ Rebellion.

10-feb-1995:
	AGPU: movsi/addsi/subsi optimised.

12-feb-1995:
	AGPU: CCR inheritance active again. "btst" use added.

14-feb-1995:
	AGPU: Test-and-set constant folding improved.

16-feb-1995:
	AGPU: Fixed pb in tstsi with le and leu.
	Reported by Dan @ Rebellion.
	AGPU: Put _RTS macro instead of inlining it, allowing easier use in
	assembly code.
	Derived from a report by Dan @ Rebellion.

20-feb-1995:
	AGPU: Fixed (for the last time hopefully) the reverse branch pb. It
	could happen in some very special cases that a cmp staid reversed
	instead of being reversed again because of the dbr pass.

21-feb-1995:
	AGPU: "bset" use added.

	Brainstorm.
