Re:   Jaguar CD Mastering

Keep in mind that CD Writers are evolving and will not neccesarily work
correctly out of the box.  It’s likely you will have to fiddle around
with your system before things work correctly.

You absolutely must adhere to the CD layout described in the “Jaguar
CD-ROM” chapter of the Jaguar Developer’s documentation.  This is not a
suggestion, it is a requirement.  Failure to follow this format will
cause your program to fail on a production system, even if it does work
on a developer model Jaguar CD player.  Remember to always use the
proper track header and tailer and keep in mind that the boot code is
always the first track of the second session.

All tracks of a Jaguar CD are written in “CD-DA” format using
Motorola-style byte ordering.  The frame size is 2352 bytes with an
“audio” sub-code.  Overall, the Atari Jaguar CD standard is very close
to what Sony, Phillips, and Microsoft named “CD Plus” (Phillips Blue
Book proposal 3/95).

1.  Different combinations of CD Writer and CD mastering software have a
different approaches to handing small files.  Tracks smaller than 1
megabyte in length should be padded with zeroes at the end (after the
track tailer) to increase their size to 1 megabyte.  Otherwise the
information can get garbled.

2.  Some combinations of CD Writer and CD mastering software have been
known to insert a leading word (two bytes) with a value of zero in front
of each track.  This causes Jaguar to fail to read the data on a long
boundary.  At a minimum, this means your program cannot boot.  A simple
and proven workaround is to insert another dummy word of zero at the
start of the track file, before the Atari track header.

3.  Some writer/software combinations have been known to perform
byte-swapping on the date before writing it to the CD.  This renders the
CD useless for Jaguar, unless you’ve previously byte-swapped your data
to account for this.  This may be configurable in your CD mastering
software.

Here is a current list of Writer/Software/BIOS combinations that have
been tried by Atari, including the problems noted and the required
workarounds (if available):

CD Writer/BIOS Version Combinations:
------------------------------------
A — Phillips CDD522, BIOS v1.00		
B — Phillips CDD522, BIOS v1.06		
C — Plasmon RF4100 BIOS v1.28		
D — Yamaha CDR100 BIOS v1.06		
E — Yamaha CDR100 BIOS v1.09		
					
CD Mastering Software
---------------------
1 — WinOnCD Pro 2.13
2 — WinOnCD ToGo 1.3
3 — Easy CD Pro & MM 3.0
4 — WinOnCD Pro 2.13, w/ WR_YAM.DLL 4/5/95
5 — WinOnCD ToGo 1.3, w/ WR_YAM.DLL 4/5/95
6 — disComposer V2.0beta
7 — WinOnCD Pro 2.13, w/ WR_YAM.DLL 6/7/95
8 — WinOnCD ToGo 1.3, w/ WR_YAM.DLL 6/7/95

   C	     1        Yes    No**    OK (with padding word)
   D	     4        Yes    Yes***  unusable for Jaguar
   E	     5        Yes    Yes***  unusable for Jaguar
   E	     7        Yes    No**    OK (with padding word)
   E	     8        Yes    No**    OK (with padding word)
   D	     3        Yes    Yes     OK*
   E	     3        Yes    Yes     OK*
   D	     6        Yes    Yes     OK*
-------------------------------------------------------------
* = Inconvenient, because must byte-swap data before writing.
** = May be controlled via software
*** = Does not do it consistently
-------------------------------------------------------------

The currently most recommended approach is to cancel out the word
mis-alignment by adding another padding word at the beginning of the
file and to use one of the combinations of hard and software marked in
bold.

Technical Support and driver updates of the most commonly used CD Writer
Software can be found in the CD Vendor B Forum on Compuserve (GO
CDVENB).  More specifically:

Atari has not tried all possible combinations of CD writer, writer BIOS
versions, and CD mastering software.  Anything not listed in this table
should considered as unexplored territory as far as Jaguar is concerned,
so be careful.

The safest way to find out what REALLY happens on writing a CD is: Burn
a sample CD with a track containing the standard track header at the
beginning.  Now use the Jaguar to read the track back into memory with
CD_init and CD_read.  Finally, look in the buffer for the 16 longwords
of ‘ATRI’ from the track header.  They should be readable, not
byte-swapped (i.e.  ‘ATRI’ not ‘TAIR’) and should be found in memory a
longword boundary.  If this is not the case, then you will have to apply
an appropriate workaround as outlined above.
