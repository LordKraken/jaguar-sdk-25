	  automatically loaded at start if found in current path or RDBRC.

	+ Few minor cosmetic changes (Menu titles...).
	+ Dir window automatically closes if called by Aread, Read or Load.

	  If there are more than 10 windows, then the menu entry "Activate"

	  to ASCII equivalents for transcript. Also, line ends are now CRLF under
	  Atari/TOS and PC/DOS, LF under PC/Linux.

	  the first byte free.
	+ *.* default selection in the Directory window changed to * for PC/DOS

	  Wish of Scott Sanders @ Atari Corporation.

31-oct-1994:
	+ Minor change: now if the debugger receive an event from the Jaguar
	  while doing nothing, it handles that event. You had to hit <return>
	  in previous releases. For instance, if you push the reset button,
	  you'll now get the Stub message on the fly.

20-nov-1994:
	+ Linux: WDB is now a gpm client (for the mouse). You must have gpm
	  v0.94 or greater.

25-nov-1994:
	+ The mouse is now blocked when trying to over-minimize or over-maximize a
	  window.
	+ Double-clicking on a window's title/move bar has the same effect as
	  clicking on its fuller gadget.
	+ Double-clicking on a iconified window uniconifies it.
	+ An "autofocus" mouse behaviour is obtained by setting the `autofocus'
	  internal variable to something != 0.

26-nov-1994:
	+ Resizing is now also possible on the left of a window, by dragging the
	  left border with the mouse (same as down and right borders).
	  Also, the upper left corner can be used for resizing.

28-nov-1994:
	- Bug while determining if the contents of a dump window have to be
	  refreshed after setting memory.
	- Also, if a refresh was done, the window was also relocked. This is
	  fixed.
	  Same thing for disassembly window.

04-dec-1994:
	+ Changed Modules Window. It now displays N/A instead of `?' if the file
	  is not available. Also, module filenames are displayed first and the
	  pathname after, since it is usually quicker and enough to see the filename
	  only.
	- Also fixed a bug that could occur when trying to load an ABS file with a
	  non-existent first source file (was saying "read error" in the ABS file).

24-dec-1994:
	- Fixed a bug that reduced Console Window command line to the size of the
	  last Dialog Box command line after using it.
	+ Added a Menu to Disassembly and Source window.
	+ Reworked a bit other window specific menus.

02-jan-1995:

	  (This window will be improved in the future).
	+ Reworked a bit Breakpoints and Checkpoints windows.
	+ Fixed a (minor) bug in Symbols window.
	+ Removed unnecessary under-titles in array-style windows.

04-jan-1995:
	+ Allowed re-creating Console Window, which does not create another
	  window but really move/resize the existing one. So, in wdb.rc,
	  Console Window is saved as the other windows, thus allowing
	  customisation for its size/position.

05-jan-1995:
	+ Added space bar for page down in Disassembly window.

07-jan-1995:
	= Changed "stoP" entry in Context menu to "Halt".

11-jan-1995:
	- Fixed a pb when duplicating a window: it has not gadgets!
	- Fixed a pb with "x" command. Was unsigned since 02-jan-1995.

14-jan-1995:
	- Linux: Fixed a pb in `suspend' since WDB is a GPM client. Was stuck
	  after `fg'.

17-jan-1995:
	+ Added a sort option to Symbols window. Simply click on the title you
	  want the symbols sorted by. Click on the current sort title to unsort.

18-jan-1995:
	+ Added a close gadget to console window, which acts the same as File/Quit
	  menu option. Suggestion of Mike Beaton.
	= Changed File/"Informations" entry to "About ...". Suggestion of Mike
	  Beaton.
	- Fixed Checkpoints Window: It had no gadgets!
	- Fixed User Windows: they had no gadgets!

19-jan-1995:
	= Changed back File/"About" entry to "Information" because the shortcut is
	  unpleasant.
	- Linux: added a "Reset colors" to "CLS" after 'suspend' or '!'. Still
	  lacks a fflush(stdout) when you come back to WDB on the last line of
	  console window, the first line and a half of console window is grey
	  until you do something ...
	  Bug report by Dan @ Rebellion.

20-jan-1995:
	- Fixed a pb in dump window, was not displaying good values after the 1024th
	  byte (only happened in more than 80x50).
	- Fixed a pb when a message containing whitespaces is displayed in the
	  console window in background. It was doing a CR after each whitespace.

20-feb-1995:
	= Linux: Recompiled with new gpm 0.97 lib/header, because it didn't work
	  with it any more (same for Midnight Commander, BTW).
	! WARNING: You MUST now have gpm 0.97 in order to use wdb, since it is
	  incompatible with older versions. You can find it on our BBS.
	  Thanks to Jeremy Gordon @ Hyper Image Productions, Inc.

24-feb-1995:
	- Linux: Added a fflush(stdout) after mouse-selecting a file in directory
	  window.

	- A simple ASCII window.
	- A simple Watch window.
