This archive includes the QSound 3D sound field processor for the 
Atari Jaguar, as well as a demonstration program that shows how it
works.

The demonstration features a helicopter sound and other digitized
effects.  By pushing left or right on the Jaguar controller, you can
make the sound pan from one side to the other.  The sound doens't even
appear to be coming from the speakers.  The illusion is quite effective.

The Qsound routines are contained in the QSOUND.OT object module.  See
the documentation so that your own programs can implement this exciting
new software technology.

If you don't already have it in printed form, the QSound documentation
is contained in the JAGUAR\DOCS\QSOUND.DOC file.  This is an MS Word For
Windows 6.0 file.  Also included is an ONLINE readable version of this
document which uses the WordPerfect Envoy reader running under MS
Windows. This is the \JAGUAR\ONLINE.DOC\QSOUND.EXE program.  Simply 
double-click the file from the FILE MANAGER to execute it.

If you are unable to use either piece of documentation, and do not already
have a printed version as part of your Jaguar documentation, then please
contact Mike Fulton at Atari via telephone at (408) 745-8821 or fax at
(408) 745-2088.
