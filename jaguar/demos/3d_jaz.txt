Welcome to JAZ!
---------------

This is a new DEMO (!) of JAZ.  JAZ is the newly developed Jaguar
Audio System. It contains the new JAGsynth and a powerful tool to
create sounds, effects and whole songs. The features are:

JAGsynth:

- up to 14 voices
- second MIDI score for sound effects
- modular and flexible. JAGsynth creates sound using a programmable
  algorithm. You can combine oscillators (sample player, FM, ROM wave
  and poly wave) with distortion and filter modules and use up to
  3 LFOs or envelopes. As additional effects you have delay, reverb
  and a surround encoder.
- utilizes sample pre-fetch to avoid bus problems

JAZ:

- GUI with mouse support
- with JAZ you edit every parameter the new synth offers
- realtime MIDI parser turns your Jaguar in a polyphonic synthesizer.
  So you are able connect your favourite sequencer and compose a song.
- JAZ creates a "ready-to-start" source code from your song that can
  easily be integrated in your game code.
  
  
NOTE:

This demo of JAZ is integrated with a demo of the 3D graphics library. 
Note that this demo contains a BETA (!) version of the synth which has still
some problems (i.e. some note offs seem to be unrecognized). Nevertheless
the demo gives you a good impression what is possible with the new software.

Make sure you have good speakers hooked up to your Jaguar before you
play the demo!
